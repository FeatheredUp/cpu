            <div>There are 10 flower beds to find.  There is one of length 4, two of length 3, three of length 2, and four singles.
                A flower bed cannot touch another flower bed, even diagonally.
                The numbers along the edge of the grid indicate how many squares contain flower beds in that row or column.
                A few flower bed positions are already known.
